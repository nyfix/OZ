# Performance

## Performance Testing
OpenMAMA includes rudimentary performance-testing programs, as documented at <https://openmama.finos.org/openmama_performance_testing.html>.

### Testing with qpid

```
source qpid-pubsub.sh
./producer.sh -s AAAA
```

```
source qpid-pubsub.sh
./consumer.sh -s AAAA

> NOTE that with the native OpenMAMA qpid transport, the producer **MUST** be started before the consumer -- if the consumer is started first, it will not receive any messages.  This is a limitation of the qpid transport, and does not apply to OZ -- with OZ the producer and consumer can be started in any order.

### Testing with OZ

```
source oz-nsd.sh
./nsd.sh
```

```
source oz-nsd.sh
source omnmnsg.sh
./producer.sh -s AAAA
```

```
source oz-nsd.sh
source omnmnsg.sh
./consumer.sh -s AAAA

### Results
The OpenMAMA producer/consumer test measures message *rates* -- the producer sends as quickly as possible.

In this test, the qpid transport can acheive a rate of approximately 31,000 messages per second, while OZ with ZeroMQ manages around 650,000 messages per second, or about 20x the rate with qpid.

> Note that these results are **without** pinning either process to a CPU, which confers an advantage on OZ -- ZeroMQ is better able to take advantage of multiple cores, while qpid is essentially single-threaded on both the producer and consumer.

The above results were obtained with:

- 4 x Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770R CPU @ 3.20GHz (with hyperthreading)
- 16GB RAM
- CentOS 7.7

The tests were run with qpid in point-to-point ("p2p") mode -- i.e., without a broker.  Performance with a brokered configuration, which is typical for qpid, would likely be less.
